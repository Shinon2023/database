Macaque Yuzu Edition Zoologist Perfumes ,Zoologist Perfumes,for women and men,"woody,amber,fresh spicy,aromatic,citrus,warm spicy,sweet,balsamic,green","Macaque Yuzu Edition  by  Zoologist Perfumes  is a fragrance for women and men.  Macaque Yuzu Edition  was launched in 2021. The nose behind this fragrance is Mackenzie Reilly. Top notes are Yuzu, Juniper Berries and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Hinoki Wood, Myrrh and Labdanum; base notes are Olibanum, Sandalwood and Oakmoss. ","Against the backdrop of a mountainous terrain, two communities share a peaceful coexistence. Yet despite their proximity, the societies are distinctly unique. Macaques cavort among the trees, grasping with delight at natureâ€™s bountiful pleasures. From the quiet solemnity of a nearby temple, their human neighbours regard them, coveting the monkeysâ€™ playful abandon. The macaques are all but oblivious, sparing only the briefest of curious glances at the pensive faces below before surrendering once again to their carefree revels. 
 Sweet notes of yuzu dance through a pine forest, welcoming you to Zoologist Macaque. Incense adds gravity with aromas of Hinoki woods and myrrh. The delicate balance between heavy and light results in an austere woody scent with mild hints of creamy sandalwood. Macaque is exuberance tempered by calm, sublimity buoyed by joy, a happy harmony of meditative bliss.

","Massive and stubborn, the Rhinoceros takes stock of his territory under the unrelenting sun. His weathered hide protects him from the merciless heat and eroding drum of sand in the wind, as he protects his domain. 
 Rhinoceros Eau de Parfum establishes itself with a dry, slightly boozy rum note, like heat shimmering on the still savannah. The air crackles with lavender and sage. A warm breeze carries the scent of leather and rich tobacco. In the distance a rugged, dignified behemoth contemplates the vast expanse while amber, vetiver, smoke and sandalwood drift on the horizon. 
 This substantial and captivating scent blends the traditionally masculine and high quality notes of leather, vetiver, cedar, bergamot, and sandalwood with the more mellow rum, tobacco, lavender, and agarwood. The result is a musky, well-balanced, enigmatic, and alluring accord.

The elephants fulfill a vital role â€“ purging the delicate ecosystem, allowing new life to flourish.

Top notes are Cardamom, Calamus and Rose; middle notes are Atlas Cedar, Labdanum, Patchouli and Jasmine Sambac; base notes are Ambrette (Musk Mallow), Sandalwood, Laotian Oud and Orris. ","Brutal winter winds buffet theÂ Siberian forest. The tall treesÂ long for summer's return, short though it may be. But at the base of several bare trunks, invisible love notesÂ call to a would-be mate. The fragrant missives are secretions left by the male musk deer. Long fangs give the buck a demonic appearance, but they too play a role in the mating ritual â€“ weapons in the tussle with rivals for a doe's love. The dream of a mate sustains the lonely musk deer as it searches out scraps of lichen and moss among cold, barren roots. 
 Â  
 For centuries musk deer have been hunted to near extinction, coveted for their fragrant musk pods. Zoologist respects this majestic creature, masterfully recreating the distinctive scent though a mixture ofÂ synthetic musks and natural oud and florals. The result evokes the animal desire of a lusty musk deer amid the alluring chill of a wintry forest, all captured without a hint of menace.

The most noble and timeless fragrance of the collection. The most magical and powerful essence in the reverberation of his memory.

The powerful tranquillity of his hand as he led us safely around the fire of the kitchen bright with cakes and sweets or of the crackling focarina bonfire in the wood. A perfume that speaks of glittering love, of reassuring tenderness, of a joyful eve that preannounces the greatest celebration in the world: that of life. An extract dedicated to those who like to distinguish themselves with style that is understated but clear-cut, unique but elegant, powerful but not egocentric. A perfume that opens with rich harmonies of citrus fruits from the sunniest of Italian orchards. Mandarin and bergamot thus blend with Sicilian oranges lending a subtle freshness to the timeless elegance, because beauty derives not from fashion but from style. The citrus notes lie on a base of sweet fruits, like pineapple and lovely and sweetscented flowers like jasmine, violet and rose, strongly reverberated by the unique force of amber. The stylistic construction gracefully rests on a powerful base note of precious woods such as sandal and white oud sweetened and emphasised by the vertical depth of Musk. A perfume that has been used throughout the history of Italian luxury artistic perfumery, reinterpreted by the artisan skill and by the love that only unique products, carefully and slowly created one by one by hand, are able to give only to those who are sufficiently sensitive to appreciate them. A limited collection offered only to those who truly have the elective affinity to understand the timeless value of beauty and very sophisticated elegance, contained forever in the simplicity of a drop of liquid emotion.

The essence of summer, without a care in the world, and full of inebriating scents blown into the area by the â€œMeltemiâ€ (typical wind of these latitudes), with its warm, sensual embrace, is magically contained in this fragrance inspired by the unspoiled, ancestral beauty of the Mediterranean.
The strong aroma of coffee, made in an ancient â€œmokaâ€ (typical coffee-making machine) floats through the crisp morning air, penetrated by the iridescent light reflected in the sea. The gaze immediately hurtles towards that infinite blue, framed by plants and flowers with a strong scent, made even sweeter and more mellow by the faraway reverberation of scents of honey and sweet amber resin.
Precious essences jealously guarded in ultra-fine glass bottles, which recall the ancient splendors of the island, still there in the form of its famous ruins of the temples of Apollo where Ulysses landed during his epic adventures.
The hypnotic force of white hyacinth, combined with the opulence of royal iris and ecstasy rose, surrenders itself to the embrace of sweet myrrh and roasted coffee, against a fine background of amber and cypress notes, mellowed by hints of honey. The entire combination is enhanced by the strong hint of Lebanese cedar wood.

 Like Phoenician sailors, transported from Maltemi, we headed on toward the ruins of the Lycian civilization, between untouched coves and pine-covered hills reach down to the sea, surrounded by slopes covered in thyme, sage, bay trees and rare, almost extinct, GÃ¼nlÃ¼k, ""Incense trees"" that perfume the air in a breathtaking explosion of colours and essences. A scent of wild and lush nature, both sweet and warm at the same time, emphasised by the intense smell of melted caramel that comes from small camps at the foot of the mountain, where we rest before the climb. This fragrance reverberates in the air and is reflected in the blue of the sea, passing by the ruins of the ancient city to reach the lighthouse at Cape Gelidonya, which stands alone in a place full of history and legends. The tensions and attractions of this combination of elements, fire and water, have been captured and enclosed in a perfume extract made from rare and precious natural raw materials. This untouched territory, rugged and wild, gathers within itself all the splendour and strength of the Mediterranean that from its belly, like an ancient Greek deity, breathes supernatural and magical fire giving rise to Chimera.

Today Bigia Anniversaries, based on a classic family recipe, explores new boundaries with the inclusion of innovative molecules and takes a step towards the artistic reappraisal of a timeless classic. Saffron rests on a base of white oud macerated for 20 years with Bulgarian rose absolute, to give the creation a magical, sensual and extraordinarily long-lasting touch. Precious ambers follow each other with the fruity notes of our beautiful Italy, enveloped in wild flower heart notes. Naturally, like all the fragrances in the collection, this extract too is unisex.

","""Dance is poetry made visible, fragrance is a dance of molecules invisible. 
 Internationally-fÃªted ballet dancer, Polina Semionova, is Schoenâ€™s creative partner for the new fragrance in the series, Precision & Grace. 
 â€œI was fascinated by what goes on in the mind of a great dancer while sheâ€™s dancing,â€ says Schoen, â€˜in the precision she must have to express the grace.â€ 
 â€œWithout intelligent work, there is no result,â€ explains Semionova. â€œeven if you have a great gift. The precision only comes with hours of work in the studio. Then, when I go on stage, I donâ€™t think anymore. I release myself to the music. I fly.â€ 
 The fragrance is balanced between uplifting fruity notes and powdery florals. â€œI wanted to have pear and plum because they remind me of summer in the Russian countryside of my childhood,â€ says Semionova. â€œWhen I smell pear and plum it makes me smile.â€ 
 The top note of Williams pear springs out of the bottle with its crisp, juicy greenness. The heart of the fragrance is an unusual fruity-floral accord of Egyptian jasmine (the fruitiest of the jasmines) with plum. Harmonising with this key accord are airy florals such as mimosa, freesia and osmanthus (a white blossom with an apricot note). 
 â€œFor me Precision & Grace connotes lightness, the gossamar layers of the classical ballerinaâ€™s costume,â€ says Schoen, â€œand then the warmth of the body as she dances.â€ 
 The drydown is warm and velvety, based on woods and musks. â€œIâ€™ve used real sandalwood because itâ€™s more complex and animalic than the synthetic versions, better able to express the heat of the body in motion.â€ 
 Schoenâ€™s signature of schinus molle, or pink pepper, also features. 
 â€œWhen you first smell Precision & Grace itâ€™s like a breeze, so light and feminine,â€ says Semionova. â€œBut then there is this unusual note that I love, the pepper. This adds something deeper that gives a core of strength to the fragrance. Itâ€™s like the ballet itself: without the hidden strength, you canâ€™t make it light.â€ 
 The packaging is an impression of the meditative state of a dancerâ€™s brain while she is performing. 
 â€œThe dots and triangles are a series of placements, they represent the precise steps she must take,â€ explains Paul White of Me Company. The colour flows reflect a different way of mapping balletic gesture. â€œDance is precise, but itâ€™s also semi-airborne. The pulses of colour reflect the flux of the dance, almost like motion capture trails. They represent the dancerâ€™s freedom, her joy."" - a note from the brand.",,"Pear,Lemon,Mandarin Orange,Bergamot","Osmanthus,Plum,Freesia,Egyptian Jasmine,Pink Pepper,Violet,Mimosa,Rose","Musk,Sandalwood,Moss,Amber,Castoreum,Myrrh",3.61,520,https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.30811.jpg,https://fimgs.net/mdimg/dizajneri/m.885.jpg

Before getting dressed each morning, every woman selects the secret, hidden wardrobe that discreetly defines her moodâ€”her lingerie. Taking inspiration from this deeply personal and intensely feminine moment, Stella McCartney developed a new interpretation of her signature fragranceâ€”STELLA NUDE.
 
 
A natural extension of the Stella McCartney Lingerie Collection, STELLA NUDE represents the first accessory every woman puts on her bare skin when getting dressed. Evoking the delicacy and femininity of Stella McCartney lingerie, STELLA NUDE reimagines the classic rose blossom to create a more intimate moment. The fragrance opens with the sensual scents of Moroccan Rose, infused with a fresh hint of grapefruit. As the fragrance reveals itself on the skin, floral heart notes of tender white peony bloom. The striking, feminine scent is invigorated with a spicy hint of pink pepper. STELLANUDEâ€™s dry notes of Ugandan vanilla and intriguing Grey Oriental combine to create a seductive base. The fragrance illuminates subtle notes found in Stella, bringing the delicate scent to life in an intimate new way.
 
 
In addition to an Eau de Toilette, STELLANUDE is available as a linen mist, allowing every woman to infuse the nude scent into her most intimate surroundings. From crisp sheets to silk slips, the mist gives any fabric the bare allure of lingerie. â€œI love the idea of walking through a scented mist in your lingerie,â€ Stella divulges. â€œItâ€™s quite a cheeky, intimate way to start the day, and itâ€™s refreshing not spraying a scent directly on your skin.â€
 
 
STELLANUDE is enclosed in a pretty pink slip case, echoing the seduction of delicate lingerie. When undressed, the vintage-inspired bottle reveals contrasting transparent and nude pink panels, implying the juxtaposition of concealed flesh against the bare skin.

Yes, if you believe that she is the abandoned part of me. Child, I have cut the world in two. On the one hand, a girl, The Vanquished â€“ not the loser! - and more precisely, that which germinated in her and which in myself, I raised; and on the other, a boy, The Victor. For a child, the world comes down to three people: himself, his mother and his father. Without everyone making such a clear-cut choice as mine, each one will be dependent on it throughout his life. 
 
 2. Did your choice present itself as the mother? 
Not the mother, her wound; I bore it. It is undeniably an identification. As for each and every one of us, I owe my life to chance. The famous throw of the dice appears exemplary to me â€“ it is a sacred number â€“ it is the one which leads us there where we should have been born or not to have been. I shall not recall the significant episodes of my destiny but, between what was and what I felt, the difference was greater. However, the child is the clairvoyant: he foresees. Since I accorded all the qualities of the feminine to the wound, she named me. 
 
 3. From now on, should we understand that the masculine was denied in you? 
From what to my eyes was officially required: the army, authority, power, order, moralism, yes. I was at war with the Male: Maleficence. It can be expected that from this moment, I invent a woman and bring us up to date, it is the baptism of blood. 
 
 4. Coming back to the orphan girl. Is this you? 
No, originally it was a virgin territory, it attracted me but I didnâ€™t recognise myself there; this territory which I denied was that of men. My mother, she was the wrath and I, her son, its revenge. 
 
 5. And the father, where is he? 
The father is the declared enemy. I was hatred on Earth, on Father. Of the mother I was the figurehead, and of the father the assassin. The wound did not heal. I could blind myself but I could see: the father was immortal. From him I keep the feminine which he betrayed. 
 
 6. How did you recover the road to perfume in this labyrinth? 
It is the memory, forgiveness and like this, what we have today, it was able to survive: From the dust. It is not only in the feminine but it also has no plural. It is the wake of my life, that which remains when all has disappeared. It is the invisible which, veil after veil, there where it is forgotten, fades into grey.

","SJP NYC is a new fragrance by Sarah Jessica Parker, presented in cooperation with Coty Prestige, as ""Sex and The City"" alter ego of popular actress, Carrie Bradshow.
 
 On the very top of the stopper, SJP NYC is inscribed as detail which inspired creators and made a link between the popular series (movie) and the new fragrant edition.
 
 ""A large part of the inspiration was what I now understand to be peopleâ€™s impressions of seeing Carrie Bradshaw walk down the street and what feelings that evokes for her and for them â€” a real sense of freedom and possibilities, a love for the city around her and, of course, fashion,â€ Parker told WWD. â€œWe started with this idea that we wanted to create something fun. We wanted to create a party in a bottle and reflect that in the packaging with a real sense of whimsy, fun and joie de vivre. And then we took it from there. Portability and fashion played key roles in the development of the packaging and overall concept.â€
 
 This fruity-floral fragrance was created by Honorine Blanc of Firmenich, who enriched top notes with mandarin from Italy, white osmanthus and wild strawberries. A heart of SJP NYC incorporates gardenia, honeysuckle, mimosa and red Damascena rose, while a base includes vanilla absolute, sandalwood, rum and creamy musk.
 
 Sarah Jessica Parker is very surprised with sophisticated notes of accentuated elegant floral bouquet, because she expected sweet, fruity notes of strawberries and more youthful nuances. Strawberries contribute to harmony and balance of the floral composition with musk Sarah adores and prefers as ingredient in her perfumes.
 
 The collection encompasses EDTs in three sizes (15ml, 30ml and 60ml), accompanied with 200 ml body lotion. A fragrant bracelet with solid perfume is announced for May 2010.
 
 SJP NYC package is unusual and made of a simple glass flacon in a cylindrical flacon which can be used for other purposes, as well. The tin package is illustrated with various motives, which remind of Sarah Jessica Parker's wardrobe and her love for fashion.

Queen by Queen Latifah Queen Latifah ,Queen Latifah,for women,"woody,vanilla,warm spicy,amber,patchouli,balsamic,sweet,powdery,aromatic,smoky","Queen by Queen Latifah  by  Queen Latifah  is a Oriental fragrance for women.

Top notes are Mandarin Orange and Bergamot; middle notes are Cognac, Coriander, Jasmine and Rose; base notes are Vanilla, Patchouli, Tonka Bean, Incense, Sandalwood and Musk. ","The first fragrance from Queen Latifah, the charismatic and curvaceous award-winning rapper, actress and singer is presented to the market in Fall 2009, in the US, with an international roll-out shortly thereafter. According to Queen Latifah, â€œBeauty really does start on the inside. It's like a state of mind, a state of love if you will. So I see fragrance as just a natural expression of this state of love: scent expresses a womanâ€™s confidence and sensuality, itâ€™s how she embraces her body, her mind and her strength.â€ 
 â€œQueen Latifah exudes a radiant confidence and inimitable style,â€ Neil Katz, Chairman and CEO of Parlux Fragrances, Inc. observes. â€œIndividuals of all ages connect with her compelling charisma and her compassion. Every woman is a Queen in Latifahâ€™s world. With that sense of empowerment in mind, this first fragrance, Queen, naturally, expresses not simply beauty and sensuality but inner strength and an exuberant sense of confidence.â€ 
 THE FRAGRANCE 
 The glimmer of warmth illuminates the opening notes of QUEEN by Queen Latifah. A sparkling, sumptuous golden accord, reminiscent of aged Tequila, shines the light on citrus notes of Italian Bergamot and Mediterranean Mandarin. Sultry, sensual, remarkably rare Baie Rose harmonizes with Jasmine Noir, while Cognac, authoritative and intriguing, meets aromatic Moroccan Coriander as the heart of the fragrance comes to life. The base notes create a powerful, mysterious accord for this deep, rich Oriental fragrance: Indonesian Patchouli and precious Sandalwood enhance the soft allure of Vanilla and Tonka Absolute. The fragrance finishes with a graceful sojourn, made memorable with passionate Egyptian Incense and sexy Musk. 
 THE BOTTLE 
 Ruby red, delicately faceted and edged with gold borders, the bold, sexy square bottle is as dynamic as Queen Latifah herself. A dimensional heart emerges on the faÃ§ade, reinforcing Queenâ€™s message of beauty from within. 
 THE QUEEN by Queen Latifah COLLECTION 
 The bold, sexy fragrance collection includes: Eau de Parfum Spray - 3.4 oz., Eau de Parfum Spray - 1.7 oz., Body Lotion - 6.0 oz., Body Butter - 5.0 oz.
